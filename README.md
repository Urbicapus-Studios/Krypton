# Krypton
### Simple encryptor, decryptor, and encrypted file editor.

Krypton was inspired by my schools great idea to unencrypt all the data going in and out of every device on the network.
I built Krypton for easily sharing encrypted data through email, since a password is needed of AES256 encryption with OpenSSL.

Original idea:
> Verbally agree on a strong password that you and the recipient will use for sharing encrypted data
> Encrypt all the files you send to the recipient with that password
> Do you feel like a spy yet? (hint: the answer is yes)
