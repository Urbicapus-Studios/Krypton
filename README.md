# Krypton
### Simple encryptor, decryptor, and encrypted file editor.

Krypton was inspired by my schools great idea to unencrypt all the data going in and out of every device on the network.
I built Krypton for easily sharing AES256 encrypted data/files through email (or other sharing service).

Installation:
<br>
`sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Urbicapus-Studios/Krypton/master/krypton -o /usr/bin/krypton && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/krypton`

Original idea:
> Verbally agree on a strong password that you and the recipient will use for sharing encrypted data
<br>
> Encrypt all the files you send to the recipient with that password
<br>
> Do you feel like a spy yet? (hint: the answer is yes)
